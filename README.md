Each series and chunk video will have a starter script, ending script, and a current published script.  The later is the most current.  I am still refining my naming convention for these files.  

mec_hierarhcy_tool.py # Most Current
mec_hierarchy_tool_start.py # Starting File
mec_hierarchy_tool_end.py # Code at the end of the example.
mec_hiearachy_tool_01.py # Code that represents a example for the podcasts that are broken into part.
